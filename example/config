### COMMENT: take care to specify lecture duration if there is more than one
###          lecture on one day (see https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#dateoffset-objects)
### COMMENT: Specifying correct answers as a string works for single-letter responses. Multiple correct answers can be specified
###          by writing multiple characters. Answers for consecutive questions are separated by a comma.

### COMMENT: you can specify correct answers by question label
###          answers accepted as correct do not need to be single characters
###          and multiple answers can be specified as a set.
###          non-default scores are also possible (given in the order participation, correct)
###          Specifying no correct answer makes the question participation-only.
